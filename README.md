Speech Recognition: .Wav File to Text <br>
<br>
Two considerations:<br>
(1) Speech recognition does not work on low volume<br>
(2) It is not sophisticated enough to distinguish users (you would have to use an Artificial Neural Network for that)<br>

In your IDE:<br>
(1) Open your terminal and type: install speechrecognition<br>
(2) Open your preferences and install SpeechRecognition as an interpreter<br>
